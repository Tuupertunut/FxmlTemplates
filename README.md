# FXML templates

Netbeans plugin for creating standalone FXML Nodes to JavaFX projects.

This plugin adds two new creatable file types under the JavaFX category:

### JavaFX FXML Node

Creates two files. One FXML file and one Java class file which works as both the root and controller of the FXML. The Java file works as a standalone Node, meaning it can be added as a child to other Nodes.

### JavaFX FXML Application

Creates three files. A JavaFX application main class and one JavaFX FXML Node, as described in the previous section. The node is used as the root node of the application.
